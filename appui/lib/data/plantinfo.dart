They grow best in well-draining soil with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0.\n- Varieties: There are many different varieties of tomato plants, including heirloom, cherry, beefsteak, plum, and determinate or indeterminate types.\n- Harvesting: Tomatoes should be harvested when they are fully ripe and have reached their desired size and color. \n- Planting and care: Tomato plants can be started from seed indoors, 6-8 weeks before the last frost date. Transplants should be hardened off before planting outside in the garden. Tomato plants should be spaced 18-36 inches (46-91 cm) apart in rows that are 3-4 feet (0.9-1.2 meters) apart.",
